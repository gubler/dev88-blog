Overall, I would say I liked this year's crop of music better than last year's, but not to the degree of 2019 (which was really just an amazing year). New bands I came across and really liked this year were Nahtram (instrumental folk-black metal) and Stortregn (melodic tech death)

## Top Album

![In Mourning - The Bleeding Veil](http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/1c/4c/3b/1c4c3bfb-4125-52f1-c884-412109f4a394/source/600x600-72.jpg)

[In Mourning - The Bleeding Veil](https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-bleeding-veil/1592292783)

It took me a few spins to really get into this album. The last In Mourning album that took a while for me to "get" was _The Weight of Oceans_ and that has become my favorite In Mourning album - so there is a lot of hope that _The Bleeding Veil_ continues to get better (and I already really like it). This album sees In Mourning play with the more progressive elements of their sound, but still really bring the hammer when its time.

## Death

It was a pretty good year for death (and related extreme) metal. I had to cut a lot of good albums to get to this list of five. Like last year, these are in alphabetical order.

## No Death

In the realm of “everything else” there was a great crop this year. I really liked a lot of instrumental rock and shred. And post rock. Really, just a lot of great music.
