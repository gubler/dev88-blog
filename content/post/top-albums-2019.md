Again, I bring lists of musics for everyone to enjoy. This year I have tried to supply Bandcamp links where possible so you can listen to each album. In the case that the album is not on Bandcamp I have provided a link to Apple Music (because that's what I use).

## Album of the Year

[Disillusion - The Liberation](https://disillusion-official.bandcamp.com/album/the-liberation)

I _love_ Disillusion. Their album [Back to Times of Splendor](https://music.apple.com/us/album/back-to-times-of-splendor/210601185) is one of my favorite albums of all time and _The Liberation_ sits right up there as well. I am elated that after a long hiatus, Disillusion return with an amazing album.

## The Heavy Stuff

Lots of death metal here... pretty much all forms of death metal, really. I like death metal.

## No Death

As per last year, I have a second list of great albums that are not death metal, though several of them are still quite heavy (and the Lacuna Coil album has some vocals that come _very_ close to deathy-growls).

## Honorable Mentions

These are the albums that were in the running for the other lists but did not make it. These are still really good albums, but the lists have to be capped somewhere.
