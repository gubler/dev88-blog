This is a list of hardware, software, and tools I use at work and home.

I occasionally change things in my setups and this page will serve as a living document and a place to point people to when I get asked.

This is page is inspired by [uses.tech](https://uses.tech) by [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/).

## Hardware

Personally, I have a lot of computing devices that I use in different contexts.

- My [iPhone 13 Pro (graphite, 256GB)](https://www.apple.com/iphone-13-pro/specs/) is pretty much always on me and I keep it in an [Apple Red Silicone Case](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MM2L3ZM/A/iphone-13-pro-silicone-case-with-magsafe-productred) (which I only use because the leather cases this year have horrible colors). I also use the [Apple MagSage Leather Wallet](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MHLR3/iphone-leather-wallet-with-magsafe-black).
    - For headphones I use either [AirPods Pro](https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/) or [AirPods Max](https://www.apple.com/airpods-max/) (which, though expensive, I absolutely love).
- I wear an [red Apple Watch series 6 (44mm)](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-watch/apple-watch?option.watch_cases=M02H3LL/A&option.watch_bands=MG463AM/A&preSelect=false&product=Z0YQ&step=detail) with a braided solo loop (either [(Product)Red](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MY8Y2AM/A/44mm-productred-braided-solo-loop-size-6) or [Pride](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MJXH3AM/A/44mm-pride-edition-braided-solo-loop-size-6))
- For reading and playing games, I use an [iPad mini (2021, 6th Generation, wi-fi, 64GB, Purple)](https://www.apple.com/ipad-mini/). I didn't like how pale the purple was so I got a [purple dbrand Skin](https://dbrand.com/shop/ipad-mini-6-skins) for the back. When I take the mini out of the house I put it in an [orange Smart Folio](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MM6J3ZM/A/smart-folio-for-ipad-mini-6th-generation-electric-orange). I also occasionally use an [Apple Pencil (2nd Generation)](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MU8F2AM/A/apple-pencil-2nd-generation).
- My [iPad Pro, 5th Generation (2021, 12.9-inch, WiFi, 256GB)](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP844?locale=en_US) is used for watching videos, infrequent writing, and some games that benefit from the large screen. This iPad Pro lives in a[Smart Keyboard Folio](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MXNL2LL/A/smart-keyboard-folio-for-ipad-pro-129-inch-5th-generation-us-english).
- My laptop is an [M1 MacBook Air (2020)](https://www.apple.com/macbook-air/specs/) (with a [dbrand Red Carbon Fiber skin](https://dbrand.com/shop/apple-macbook-air-13-skins-2020-m1)). I got this to experiment with Apple silicon and as a couch/recliner computer.
- My main computer is a [2020 Intel 27" iMac](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP821?locale=en_US). The iMac is on an Amazon Basics VESA mount attached to [GeekDesk v1 standing desk](https://www.geekdesk.com/).
    - I use a [Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic keyboard](https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/business/sculpt-ergonomic-keyboard-for-business/5kv-00001) and a [Logitech MX Master 2s](https://www.logitech.com/en-ph/product/mx-master-2s-flow) mouse.
    - I have a [Satechi Aluminum Type-C Clamp Hub](https://satechi.net/products/aluminum-type-c-clamp-hub-pro?variant=1465750552585) and [OWC Thunderbolt Hub](https://eshop.macsales.com/shop/owc-thunderbolt-hub) to add a bunch of ports to the iMac.
    - I back up my computer to a [Samsung T5 SSD](https://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/minisite/ssd/product/portable/t5/) for Time Machine and a pair of [SanDisk Extreme Portable SSDs](https://kb.sandisk.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/20670/~/sandisk-extreme-portable-ssd-support-information) for daily and weekly whole disk backups using Carbon Copy Cloner.
    - I also have BootCamp set up to dual boot into Windows 10 for gaming.
- I also have a custom-built Windows 10 computer connected to my TV for hosting Plex and playing some games.
- Finally, I have a [Synology DS-413j](https://global.download.synology.com/download/Document/Hardware/DataSheet/DiskStation/13-year/DS413j/enu/Synology_DS413j_Data_Sheet_enu.pdf) NAS for storing all kinds of files (and a lot of videos and music for my Plex server).
- I also have a [Rasberry Pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) that I experiment with and a [Raspberry Pi Zero running Pi-Hole](https://learn.adafruit.com/pi-hole-ad-blocker-with-pi-zero-w/overview-adafruit2).

## Work Hardware

At work I use a [16" 2019 MacBook Pro](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP809?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US). The laptop is connected to a [HP Z27s](https://support.hp.com/us-en/product/hp-z27s-27-inch-ips-uhd-display/7155485/product-info) and a [Logitech C920s web cam](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/webcams/c920s-pro-hd-webcam.960-001257.html).

I use a [Keychron K3 (color LEDs, Gateron Brown switches)](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k3-wireless-mechanical-keyboard) keyboard and a [Logitech MX Master 2s](https://www.logitech.com/en-ph/product/mx-master-2s-flow) mouse which are connected to the laptop via an old HooToo HT-UH010 7-Port USB 3.0 Hub.

I recently got a [Fully Jarvis Standing Desk](https://www.fully.com/standing-desks/jarvis/jarvis-adjustable-height-desk-bamboo.html) and an [ErgoDriven Topo standing mat](https://ergodriven.com/products/topo?variant=27365321411) which I am getting used to. When I sit I use a [SteelCase Leap Plus](https://store.steelcase.com/seating/high-performance-seating/leap-plus).

My work issued me an [iPhone XR](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP781) which I barely use and it sits most of the time on an [Anker PowerWave Stand](https://www.anker.com/products/variant/powerwave-stand/A2524011).

### Work Software

Most of my development software is the same between work and personal.

The main difference between work and home is that at work I use Microsoft 365 apps, most notably:

- OneDrive for file backup/sync.
- Microsoft Edge for a browser.
- Teams for communication with my co-workers.
